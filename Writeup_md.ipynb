    "#### What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",

    "Then, after several iteration, I've applied image normalization using tensorflow per image standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it better learn I've applied dropout regularization on fully connected layers, then I figured it out applying dropout in the first fully connected layer is just good enough. Tried different values for dropout and 0.6 showed a good result.\n",
